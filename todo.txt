    Goals
        Using OpenGL 3.3+
        Less implicit / keybind-only UI
        Fix UI bugs / better object picking and property editing
        Scene graph (or at least a mesh listing)
        Undo / redo for modeling and animation
        Much better modeling + skinning performance on large meshes (point 1 and some halfedge changes will really help)
        Simpler/smaller codebase / use more straightforward C++ features
        Smaller items: rendering remotely without X forwarding, path traced animations, textures in the path tracer (maybe pbr parameters?), more checks for halfedge meshes, more mesh/scene formats, multisampling

    // BASE

    widgets
        selecting/holding arrows
        drag -> change value
        move
        rotate
        scale

    improve outlining on flat stuff - offsetting by normal looks bad
    mesh preview ??? render to texture at default pos and keep
    more basic shapes

    scene graph?

    undo/redo

    saving meshes - obj
    loading collada / glTF 2
    saving collada / glTF 2

    Mode: model

    half-edge mesh implementation
    rendering half-edge mesh as mesh
    rendering half-edge mesh as editable
    
    transform widgets per face/edge/vert
