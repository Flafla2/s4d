    Low priority:
        mesh preview in GUI
        scene graph (parenting, etc)
        changing the origin of a mesh
        loading bars/threading for big mesh ops

    [ MESHEDIT ]

    mesh files: validate against scotty3D

    select halfedge features by ID
    moving halfedge features with widgets

    second camera for mesh editing
    undo/redo integration
    more halfedge mesh validation checks

    thinking about writing contiguous memory implementation for fast iteration
        needs tombstones/compaction after steps
        needs custom iterators for elements and maybe for paths 
        (otherwise have to pass next ref back through some function)

    Mode: render (+mesh shading options)
    
    Port and simplify code
        I'd like to refactor it more like https://github.com/TheNumbat/dawn
