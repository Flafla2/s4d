Scotty4D

    Useful but low priority:
        mesh preview in GUI
        scene graph (parenting, etc)
        changing the origin of a mesh
        loading bars/threading for big mesh ops

    General:
        factor out widget rendering like halfedge renderer

    // MESHEDIT

    rendering half-edge mesh features
    selecting half-edge mesh features
    widgets per face/edge/vert
    undo/redo
    half-edge mesh validation checks

    // PATHTRACER

    Mode: render (+mesh shading options)

    // ANIMATION

    Mode: rig
    Mode: animate
    Mode: simulate
