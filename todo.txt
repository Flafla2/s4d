Addressed course_TODOs:
    general:
        rewrite picking code
        rendering meshes offsets vertices by normal
        HIDPI
        many mesh classes
    MeshEdit: will address more
    Pathtracer: will address more
        fix collada parser (assimp)

TODO:

    Useful but low priority:
        mesh preview in GUI
        scene graph (parenting, etc)
        changing the origin of a mesh
        loading bars/threading for big mesh ops
    General:
        factor out widget rendering like halfedge renderer

    [ MESHEDIT ]

    rendering half-edge mesh features
    selecting half-edge features
        set widgets to individual face/edge/vert
    undo/redo integration
    more half-edge mesh validation checks

    thinking about writing contiguous memory implementation for fast iteration
        may increase API complexity
        definitely increases implementation complexity
        needs tombstones/compaction after steps
        needs custom iterators for elements and maybe for paths 
            (otherwise have to pass next ref back through some function)

    [ PATHTRACER ]

    Mode: render (+mesh shading options)
    
    Port and simplify code
        I'd like to refactor it more like https://github.com/TheNumbat/dawn

    [ ANIMATION ]

    Mode: rig
    Mode: animate
    Mode: simulate

    Port and simplify code
