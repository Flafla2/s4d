    Goals
        Using OpenGL 3.3+
        Less implicit / keybind-only UI
        Fix UI bugs / better object picking and property editing
        Scene graph (or at least a mesh listing)
        Undo / redo for modeling and animation
        Much better modeling + skinning performance on large meshes (point 1 and some halfedge changes will really help)
        Simpler/smaller codebase / use more straightforward C++ features
        Smaller items: rendering remotely without X forwarding, path traced animations, textures in the path tracer (maybe pbr parameters?), more checks for halfedge meshes, more mesh/scene formats, multisampling

    // BASE

    mesh picking for selection
    loading & saving meshes

    mesh preview ??? render to texture at default pos and keep
    default meshes of different shapes

    object transforms/scene graph
        UI on selected object
        movement, rotate, and scale widgets

    undo/redo

    // MESHEDIT

    half-edge mesh implementation
    rendering half-edge mesh information & picking

    loading & saving meshes

    // PATHTRACER

    // ANIMATIOn
