    [ MESHEDIT ]

    set widgets to halfedge features
    moving halfedge features

    undo/redo integration
    more halfedge mesh validation checks

    thinking about writing contiguous memory implementation for fast iteration
        needs tombstones/compaction after steps
        needs custom iterators for elements and maybe for paths 
        (otherwise have to pass next ref back through some function)
